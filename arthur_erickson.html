                        </h2>
                        <p>The Arthur Erickson website was a deep dive into showcasing the legacy of a visionary architect. The project began with research into Erickson's work to understand the philosophy behind his designs. The website was envisioned as a digital exhibition, highlighting Erickson's projects with rich visual and textual narratives.</p>
                        <p>This was a school project from IAT 235 which was Information design from SFU.
                        I was tasked to create a website from a famous architect. I chose Arthur Erickson because I not only was interested in his work, but I also know that given the choice between creating a website for a company or Arthur Erickson, I had a greater desire to create a website for Arthur Erickson because at that time I did not have much experience in creating websites for companies. I added the information about the introduction of the architect, the projects he has done, and the philosophy behind his designs using HTML/CSS.

                            <p>Developing the site called for a minimalist design that could mirror Erickson's architectural style—modern and nature-centric using Figma. With this in mind, I employed a clean layout with plenty of whitespace, allowing Erickson's work to stand front and centre. Interactive galleries were developed using HTML5 and CSS3, echoing the sophistication of Erickson's designs.</p>

                            <p>I first started by adding the information about the introduction of the architect, the projects he has done, and the philosophy behind his designs using Figma. I also added the navigation bar to the top of the page so that the user can navigate through the website easily. I also added contact information, date and location as well as admission fee and ticket information of the website all under a single template.</p>

                                Initially, all the content about Arthur Erickson – including his biography, architectural projects, and design philosophy – was presented on a single page. This design approach resulted in a cluttered and confusing user interface, as users typically expect different types of content to be segmented across various pages.

                                <p>The solution involved reorganizing the website’s content into separate pages. By segmenting the introduction, detailed project information, event details, and contact information onto different pages, the website's navigation became clearer and more user-friendly. This approach aligned with best practices for web design, enhancing the overall usability and aesthetic of the site.</p>

                                <p>Reflecting on the Arthur Erickson Architectural Portfolio project, it's clear that user experience is paramount. Shifting to a minimalist design enhanced the site's clarity and usability, while interactive elements invited deeper engagement with Erickson's work. The introduction of a clear navigation bar and the strategic distribution of content across multiple pages were critical in resolving initial user interface challenges.
                                
                                This project highlighted the importance of iterative design and user feedback. By continuously refining the website, we were able to create a more intuitive and educational platform. These changes not only improved navigation but also ensured that each of Erickson's projects was given the attention it deserved. Ultimately, this process underlined the significance of adaptability and user-focused design in creating compelling digital experiences.</p>
