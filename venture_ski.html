                            This was a group project from IAT 339 which was Web Design and Development from SFU and we have completed this project in IAT 339 Group Project.

                            For the Peak Value Ski Agency, we were tasked to design a website that could encapsulate the exhilarating experience of skiing while providing an efficient booking system. We kicked off the project by researching the target audience—ski enthusiasts—and the competitive landscape. Collaborative ideation led to a concept that balanced vivid imagery with user-friendly navigation.

                        <p>I was responsible for the implementation of core website components using HTML. My efforts were centred on crafting a compelling introduction to the company, detailing the services provided, and embedding a booking system. The booking system was particularly crucial, designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, leveraging JavaScript to facilitate seamless navigation through date selection and package customization. High-definition images were strategically placed throughout the site to visually convey the thrill of skiing, enhanced by parallax scrolling effects to add a sense of depth and immersion.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection on Solutions:</h2>
                        <p>The late realization of the need for a thematic realignment of the website’s design underscored the importance of early and continuous thematic validation throughout the development process. This experience highlighted the necessity of aligning every design element with the project's thematic and functional goals from the outset.                          
                            Addressing the payment integration challenge by enhancing the account page functionality marked a pivotal improvement in the website's usability. This adjustment not only solved a critical issue but also set a precedent for prioritizing user convenience and security in transactional functionalities.
                            In reflecting on these solutions, it's evident that addressing both aesthetic and functional challenges was crucial in developing a website that not only meets the users' expectations but also provides an engaging and seamless experience. The insights gained from this project underscore the importance of flexibility, user-centric design, and the continuous evolution of website functionalities to meet and exceed user needs.</p>
