                        <p>
                            BaroNav is a barometric pressure tracking app developed for IAT 359: Mobile Computing at Simon Fraser University (SFU). The app leverages smartphone barometer sensors and GPS data to provide personalized, location-based weather insights. Users can track real-time atmospheric pressure, analyze historical trends, and integrate external weather services for comprehensive forecasting.
Our focus was to make barometric pressure a key factor in weather-related decision-making while ensuring accurate, data-driven, and visually intuitive insights.

                            Mobile Application Development (Java, XML, Android Studio)
                            Developed a fully functional interactive map, allowing users to save, edit, and navigate locations seamlessly.
                            Designed a smooth and responsive UI layout to enhance location management and usability.
                            Implemented data visualization tools to track atmospheric pressure trends.
                            User Interface & Experience Design (Figma, Wireframing, UX/UI Design)
                            Refined XML layouts for the home screen and map navigation, improving intuitiveness.
                            Designed pin-based selection and manual location entry for accessibility.
                            Developed a visually clear and engaging UI to make barometric pressure insights easy to understand.</p>

                            <p></p>The realization of this mismatch prompted a strategic pivot in the design approach. I undertook additional research to identify a web design style that would more accurately reflect the skiing theme. This critical adjustment, although realized later in the development process, was essential in realigning the website’s aesthetic with its thematic goals, thereby ensuring a more authentic and engaging user experience.</p>
